# weather-pipeline

The goal of this project is to build a weather data pipeline on Google Cloud Platform that:
- [x] starts with a sensor from IoT, 
- [x] utilizes a message queue to receive and deliver data, 
- [x] leverages a serverless function to move the data to a data warehouse and then, 
- [x] create a dashboard that displays the information.
